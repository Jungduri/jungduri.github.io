I am a Research at NAVERZ, where one of the biggest and most promising companies in the world with regards to metaverse services. I am highly interested in how real-world visual information can be delivered (e.g. video, image, and AR/VR), interpreted(e.g. joints estimation and segmentation), and utilized(e.g. motion generation).

I studied computer vision in the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Green Transportation from KAIST in 2018(advisor Prof. Kyung-Soo Kim), and received my Bachelor of Science in electronics engineering from Inha University in 2015.

In my current position at NAVERZ, I am able to research the interface and connection between the real world and the virtual world. My team and I have been utilizing visual information offered by users, including learning-based motion capture for portable cameras, light estimation, etc.
